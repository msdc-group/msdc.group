      <h2>How we work</h2>
<p>MSDCG accepts 3-4 strategic engagements annually through selective referral. We work alongside leadership teams on hands-on execution, applying strategies that scaled Wondery (acquired by Amazon Music) and Chartable (acquired by Spotify), and platform product experience from building video podcast features at Amazon.</p>

<p>Typical engagements involve 3-6 month commitments with weekly collaboration. We establish clear success metrics upfront, track progress against outcomes, and adjust tactics based on results.</p>

<p>To explore working together, request an introduction from a mutual connection in the audio, video, or podcast ecosystem.</p>
