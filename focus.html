    <div class="content">
      <h2>Focus</h2>
      <p><strong>Audience Scale</strong><br>Grow audiences from thousands to millions across YouTube, Spotify, Apple, and emerging platforms. Sustainable growth, not viral spikes.</p>
      <p><strong>Distribution Strategy</strong><br>Maximize reach across RSS, VOD, FAST, YouTube, and platform-specific features. Compound discovery by engineering how content travels and where it surfaces.</p>
      <p><strong>Increase Revenue</strong><br>Diversify beyond advertising into subscriptions, sponsorships, platform deals, and enterprise partnerships. Build revenue models that increase company valuation.</p>

      <h2>Method</h2>
      <p><strong>Define Outcomes</strong><br>Establish specific growth targets and constraints upfront. Document strategy in writing with clear success metrics and timeline commitments.</p>
      <p><strong>Execute Strategy</strong><br>Work alongside leadership teams to implement audience acquisition, optimize distribution, and close revenue deals. Hands-on execution, not advisory from the sidelines.</p>
      <p><strong>Measure and Adapt</strong><br>Track progress against agreed outcomes weekly. Adjust tactics based on platform data, audience behavior, and revenue performance.</p>
